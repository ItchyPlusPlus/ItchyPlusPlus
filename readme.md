Welcome to the Itchy++ repository!
Itchy++ is a Scratch-like program made in C++.

It is still in early devolopment stages so check back later.

# Compilation
######Warning, compiling is for more advanced people.

If you want to check what we have so far, you will have to checkout our repo and compile it. No support will be given to those who compile.

To Compile, you will need the SDL and cairo libraries, and of course, with any compication you will need a compiler.


Then compiling is just as simple as this:

    cd src
    make

It currently is in very early stages so it might fail.  If you want to help please submit a pull request.
