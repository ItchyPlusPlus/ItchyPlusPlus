Welcome to the Itchy++ repository!

Itchy++ is a Scratch-like program made in C++.

It is still in early devolopment stages so check back later.

# Compilation

Firstly you will need the SDL and cairo libraries. Then compiling is just as simple as this:

    cd src
    make

It currently is in very early stages so probably wil fail. If you want to help please submit a pull requst.
