Welcome to the Itchy++ repository!
Itchy++ is a Scratch-like program made in C++.

It is still in early devolopment stages so check back later.

# Compilation
######Warning, compiling is for more advanced people. However it is currently the only way to try Itchy++ yourself

If you want to check what we have so far, you will have to checkout our repo and compile it. No support will be given to those who compile in these early stages of development, though drop us an Issue and we may help.

To compile, you will need the SDL and cairo libraries as well as a standard GNU build system (g++, make, pkg-config etc.).

For ubuntu run this command first:

    sudo apt-get install build-essentials

Then compiling is just as simple as this:

    cd src
    make
    
Make sure there is a project.sb in the directory you are running it from.
    
It currently is in very early stages so it might fail.  If you want to help please submit a pull request.
